# Macros for regression

Repository for my SURF Caltech-CMS project on deep learning for imaging calorimetry in the LCD (Linear Collider Detector), in which we reconstruct the energy of the particles through regression.

This repository has data pre-processing functions, model topologies and post-processing functions to analyze the results.

Pre-processing dependencies: Danny Weitecamp's CMS_Deep_Learning package (https://github.com/DannyWeitekamp/CMS_Deep_Learning) for the data generator.

Machine Learning dependencies: Keras with Tensorflow in the backend.

Post-processing dependencies: Matplotlib, Scipy.
