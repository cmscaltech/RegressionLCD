# Macros for regression

Repository for my SURF Caltech-CMS project on deep learning for imaging calorimetry in the LCD (Linear Collider Detector), in which we reconstruct the energy of the particles through regression.

The notebooks that apply this back end to simulated data are in the [NotebooksLCD](https://github.com/vitoriapacela/NotebooksLCD) repository.

This repository has data pre-processing functions, model topologies and post-processing functions to analyze the results.

Pre-processing dependencies:
Danny Weitecamp's [CMS_Deep_Learning package](https://github.com/DannyWeitekamp/CMS_Deep_Learning) for the data generator.

Machine Learning dependencies:
[Keras](https://keras.io/) with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) in the backend.

Post-processing dependencies:
[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/).
